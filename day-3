Blog/Portfolio
- My portfolio is going pretty good. I feel like I'm not quite fully understanding all the assignment, but I could just be overlooking.
My wireframes are done, and I need to convert them to html css. 

- The meat and potatos of css is not fonts and color, but is layout. 

- Constructor should include name, description, language, software, image, and link.

- scaffold = eslint, gitignore, readme, reset.css, git config.
