Learning Journal
Day 6

I went through a massive downward slope last week. I was very discouraged and didn't know if I would continue the program. 
I luckly found a bit of motivation through a late night coding session and somethings started to click. I enjoyed the JSON and AJAX and 
look forward to learning about node.js this week.
