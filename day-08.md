Learning Journal
Day 08

So Far, I believe that the immersive learning style is probably the best option for learning how to code fast. 
Its is not the easiest to retain but I understand the concepts. As of right now I have a hard time seperating what 
is the difference between some of the newer stuff we have been learning. For example, I know that sql is a database for 
various information, but I'm not sure how to access it from atom, or how exactly does installing npm does effect the project. 
Some stuff goes over my head while I catch other things. Either way, I just try to review the material as much as possible
until it makes sense.
